Hi there,  I leave here your test solved.

I user a binary search tree since the constant complexity is 0(logn), and is one of the best options available. I could use a double linked list, but the complexity worst sceneario would be the same, the only difference would be the best scenario which could be O(1).  Anyways, was fun to implement that solution. 

I manage to solve and sumarry same value numbers, so the tree doest get so big. that solution means O(logn) always, but in linked lists or any other (with sort solutions) would take O(nlogn) almost. 

i think i could improve the build_stats, since i think you wanted to that funtion to do Sorts, but currently i have limited time to perform. I hope you like the solution, anyway i will always be glad to have any feedback. 

bye bye.
